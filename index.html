<p><strong><em>Anamnesis</em></strong> <strong>(<em>n</em>)</strong></p>
<p>\ ˌa-ˌnam-ˈnē-səs \</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. a remembrance of the past.</p>
<p>2. <em>Platonism</em>. the recollection of innate knowledge from a
previous existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-anamnesis">What Is Anamnesis?</h2>
<p>Anamnesis is a solo journaling game about self-discovery, reflection,
and identity.</p>
<p>You play as an individual who has woken up with memory loss. You do
not remember who you are, where you are, or what you care about.</p>
<p>As you draw tarot cards, you fill the blank spaces of your past, and
learn more about your present.</p>
<p>To play, you need a deck of tarot cards and a way to record your
thoughts (pen &amp; paper, audio recording, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
<p>While the prompts in Anamnesis are not dark or frightening, its
themes may lead you to journal about serious topics. If the content of
your journaling ever becomes too heavy or disturbing, prioritize your
mental health and step back from the game. You can always revisit the
game later or make changes to the narrative.</p>
<p>If you ever draw a card that makes you uncomfortable, or that you do
not want to journal about for any reason, discard it and draw a
different card.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-play">How To Play</h3>
<p>Separate the tarot cards into five decks: The 22 Major Arcana, The
Pentacles, The Swords, The Cups, and The Wands.</p>
<p>Shuffle each deck. Set aside the four Minor Arcana decks.</p>
<p>Draw one card from the Major Arcana deck.</p>
<p>This card is your <strong>Shadow</strong> and represents who you were
in your past. Keep your Shadow face-up next to you. Use this card as a
guide for uncovering your past.</p>
<p>There are five Acts. Each Act uses a different deck.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At the beginning of an Act, draw three cards from its corresponding
deck.</li>
<li>Place the three cards face-down in front of you.</li>
<li>Flip over the first card. Read the prompt associated with the
card.</li>
<li>Make a journal entry. Remember your Shadow.</li>
<li>Flip over the next card. Continue until you have made journal
entries for all three cards; then, move onto the next Act.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you read a prompt, draw from the Major Arcana deck. Use this
card to answer the questions in the prompt. For example, a prompt might
be the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You talked to a friend yesterday. Who was this friend? What was your
conversation about?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this prompt, the <strong>Major Arcana</strong> you draw
represents the friend you spoke with, and/or the topic of
conversation.</p>
<p>At the end of each Act, shuffle the Major Arcana cards back into the
deck.</p>
<p><strong>How you interpret the Major Arcana cards is up to
you.</strong> You could use the traditional meaning of the cards as
found in tarot guides, or you could find inspiration from the name or
design of the card. <strong>There is no wrong way to interpret the
cards.</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Alternative methods of play</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Flip over all three cards at once. Make a single journal entry for
the entire Act.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Draw three Major Arcana at the beginning of the Act. Choose which
Major Arcana goes with which prompt.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="example-of-play-1">Example of Play #1</h3>
<p>Robyn starts playing Act I, which is associated with Pentacles. They
draw three cards from the Deck of Pentacles and lay the cards face-down
in front of them. They flip over the first card, which is the Ace of
Pentacles. The prompt for this card is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You take a moment to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.
Where are you?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robyn draws a card from the Major Arcana deck. They draw The Moon.
Robyn decides they want to use the traditional meanings of tarot cards,
so they consult a tarot guide which says The Moon can symbolize danger
and darkness, among other things.</p>
<p>Robyn wants their game to take place in a fantasy setting. With this
information, Robyn writes the following journal entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I awaken with a splitting headache, laying face up on a cobblestone
road. The sky above is pitch-black and a memory prods at the edges of my
mind –- a memory of when the sun winked out during my childhood, causing
panic in the streets. Before I can dig up the details of the memory, a
dark shape rears above me. I roll to the side, narrowly avoiding the
hoof that clops down against stone. The hoof belongs to a gurrit, a
tamed beast of red shaggy fur and many eyes that gleam in the dark. The
carriage driver shakes his fist as I stumble down the nearest
alleyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-of-play-2">Example of Play #2</h3>
<p>Yolanda starts playing Act II, which is associated with Swords. She
flips over one of the cards in front of her: the Two of Swords. She
reads the prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your eyes are drawn to a statue. What is this statue of? Which
emotions does it stir in you?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She next draws a card from the Major Arcana deck: The Empress.
Yolanda prefers to interpret the cards her own way rather than use the
traditional tarot meanings. The face of the card shows a woman in a fine
dress wearing a crown, leaning against a large pillow.</p>
<p>Yolanda’s game has involved political intrigue, so she decides to
interpret the card literally. She writes the following journal
entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I walk out of the courthouse and begin squeezing my way through the
crowded street. My feet stop instinctively before I can process what’s
in front of me. In the center of the square is a statue, no fewer than
10 feet tall, depicting a woman with luscious, flowing hair. She wears a
crown on her head and holds a jeweled scepter. I don’t need to read the
plaque to remember who she is: Queen Ophelia. She recently came into
power after her father, the King, passed away. Something inside me burns
as I look over the statue, and I recognize the feeling as deep respect
and affection… but why?</p>
</blockquote>

<strong>when you are ready</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>take a deep breath</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>and wake up</strong>

<hr />
<h2 id="act-1-pentacles">Act 1: Pentacles</h2>
<p>You wake up in an unfamiliar place, seemingly within a town or city.
You cannot remember who you are or why you are here. All you know for

<p><em>Shuffle the three Major Arcana back into the deck.</em></p>
<h2 id="act-5">Act 5</h2>
<p>Your past may shape your experiences, your thoughts, your desires,
but it does not define you. You are in control of your own path. The
road ahead may be built from the stones that you’ve gathered, but these
fragments of your past do not dictate where it leads. It is time to move
forward.</p>
<p><em>Return your Shadow to the Major Arcana deck.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choose one of the Major Arcana to represent your present
self.</strong></p>
<p>Do not draw from the deck. Choose freely among the cards. You are in
charge of your own identity.</p>
<p>Who are you? What do you do next?</p>
